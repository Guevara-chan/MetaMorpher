# /Sum/:
__MetaMorpher__ is a prototype nickname falsificator, based on shared apperence between small set of cyrillic and latin letters.
Dated back to days, when _VBScript_ in browsers was still a thing, it serves mostly educational purpose for now.

# /Reassembling/:
__MetaMorpher__ was fully developed in [PureBasic v4.3](http://purebasic.com), though compatible with 5.40 (LTS).  
To rebuild - compile `MetaMorpher.pb` as root sourcefile.
